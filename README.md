# Singly Linked List Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a **Singly Linked List** data structure in C++ . The project demonstrates the core linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

---

## Project Overview

A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This project provides an educational and practical implementation to help understand how linked lists work internally.

---

## Features

- Create a singly linked list
- Insert nodes at the beginning, end, or at a specific position
- Delete nodes by value or position
- Traverse and display the list
- Search for elements in the list
- Concatanating two lists
- Merging two Sorted lists
- Removing Duplicates from Sorted list
- Additional utility methods as applicable
